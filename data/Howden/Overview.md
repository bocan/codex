I'm a principal / staff platform engineer and DevOps expert with over 30 years of IT experience.   I'm currently working as a freelance contractor for Mesh-AI - who's providing services for Howden Insurance as the end client.  I need to provide the following Deliverables for this contract:

1. Produce an ARB-ready platform design that addresses operational criticality, resilience, DR, RPO/RTO, security posture, and platform architecture across data and AI Foundry.

2. Define a forward-looking platform roadmap that sequences capabilities and improvements across SRE, security, tooling, networking, observability, and AI platform maturity.

3. Specify the permanent roles, skill sets, and operating model required for Howden to sustainably run the data and AI platforms long-term.

4. Support live engineering work (e.g., integrations, ingestion projects, AI Foundry deployment activities) to ensure platforms remain stable while strategic work progresses.

An always existing goal for this project is to generate additional follow-on work that Mesh-AI can bill for.

Taylor all discussion around the following:

* The end customer - Howden - uses:
  * Azure Cloud. The network is absolutely _feels_ over-engineered.  It's like it came from an era where it was designed by people more used to old-style / pre-cloud data centre folks.
  * Azure DevOps.
  * Azure Databricks.
  * AI Foundry?  What will use this?

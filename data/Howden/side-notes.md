# Side Notes

Key Stakeholders for us
* Mat Enston - Day-to-day stakeholder. Owns Infrastructure.
* Mitesh - Networking.  Many good files in Teams / Shared files.
* Henrietta (Hattie) Cameron Wright - Datalake.
* James Coughan - Mat's boss?
* Barry Hostead - Barry Panayi's right-hand-man - fixer of things
* Felix Oppenheimer - key customer stakeholder for AI platform
* Sarah Emerson - Head of data platform (I believe)
* Arno Conradie - Lead Data Engineer (looks after all the data engineers, and also drives the data loading framework design and adoption)
* Simon Lawrence - Data lake enterprise architect

The existing "platform" staff may be slightly hostile towards our consultancy?   We need to stay "light touch" and ensure they retain ownership and aren't made to look incompetent - because we want further business with Howden and certainly don't want the tech staff getting angry or uncooperative.  We need to follow best practice in all our technical decisions.  Think: Golden paths. Repeatability. And Resilience.

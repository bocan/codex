# Howden Platform Discovery - Synthesised Findings

## Context
- Engagement overview

  We need to provide the following Deliverables for this contract:

   - Production of a complete end-to-end design for the data platform and AI Foundry, suitable for ARB approval. This will address resilience, DR, security, operational criticality, and architectural patterns.
     - Tasks:
     - Assess current platform state across data and AI.
     - Define target architecture (data platform + AI Foundry).
     - Produce DR options incl. geo-redundancy pathways.
     - Define RPO/RTO targets and operational implications.
     - Document security controls, policies & standards.
     - Prepare ARB artefacts and narrative.

   - A structured, forward-looking roadmap describing the future evolution of the data platform and AI Foundry platforms across resilience, tooling, SRE, security, networking, AI deployment services, and observability.
     - Tasks:
     - Identify key stakeholder groups and requirements.
     - Prioritise needs across data, AI, security, infra, consumption teams.
     - Sequence capability delivery and dependencies.
     - Produce 12–18 month roadmap with milestones.
     - Define trade-offs and recommendations.

   - Definition of the future operating model for the data & AI platform team and recommended permanent roles, sequencing, and skill sets needed for Howden to support and grow the platforms.
     - Tasks:
     - Evaluate current platform engineering capacity & gaps.
     - Define functional responsibilities across SRE, security, networking, AI Ops, platform engineering.
     - Produce detailed role descriptions.
     - Recommend recruitment sequencing and onboarding model.
     - Provide options for future LLM Ops and AI Ops specialisation.

   - Provide senior engineering expertise to unblock and accelerate ongoing delivery work such as ingestion pipelines, Applied Epic BE integrations, network/security setup, or AI Foundry deployments.
     - Tasks:
     - Hands-on engineering, pairing and troubleshooting.
     - Advisory support to pods and platform consumers.
     - Implement or review network and security configurations.
     - Review ingestion and replication patterns (SQL, ADLS, Databricks options).
     - Support Data Science team with AI Foundry activation & deployment patterns.
     - Help stabilise platform services under current workloads.

   - An always asperational existing goal for this consultancy is to generate additional follow-on work that Mesh-AI can bill for.

- Timeline/deadlines

  - My personal aim is that much of the above should be complete by the 21st of April when I'm last show as assigned to this project.
  - Firmer dates as I know them.

- Key stakeholders
  - Me, Chris Funderburg, Lead Platform Engineer at Mesh-AI
  - James Bowkett, Consulting Director at Mesh-AI
  - Mat Enston, Head of Data Platform Engineering & Operations (Day-to-day stakeholder. Owns Infrastructure).
  - Henrietta (Hattie) Cameron Wright - Datalake.
  - Mitesh - Networking.  Many good files in Teams / Shared files.
  - James Coughan - Mat's boss?
  - Barry Hostead - Barry Panayi's right-hand-man - fixer of things
  - Felix Oppenheimer - key customer stakeholder for AI platform
  - Sarah Emerson - Head of data platform (I believe)
  - Arno Conradie - Lead Data Engineer (looks after all the data engineers, and also drives the data loading framework design and adoption)
  - Simon Lawrence - Data lake enterprise architect
